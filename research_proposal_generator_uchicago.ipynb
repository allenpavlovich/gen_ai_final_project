While the more complex models tested were able to achieve consistently good performance, systemic biases in automated evaluation protocols, and overtly rigid prompting can lead to different conclusions20.

Traditionally, evaluation metrics for these models have emphasized the semantic and grammatical accuracy32 of generated text, as well as their proficiency in solving multiple-choice questions.

Additionally, models which operate purely within chat-interfaces are subject to the possibility of “jailbreaking”39 – wherein malicious natural language instructions can override the model’s operating instructions. Agentic operation reduces or entirely removes human input for operation, and largely reduces such misuse potential-especially useful for information-controlled hospital settings. Our work must be considered alongside its limitations. First, curation and translation of cases from the electronic healthcare record to JSON files needed human intervention, as well as subsequent evaluation of long-form LLM responses. Therefore, we were limited in terms of the overall sample size of the study.

      "Despite these limitations, the MEDAIDE framework pro- vides a solid foundation for advancing the integra- tion of artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostics. Ethics Consideration Ethical considerations are paramount in the appli- cation of medical agents to real-world clinical set- tings. We are fully aware of the potential impacts of our research and have taken deliberate actions to address these issues. To enhance transparency, we are committed to publicly making the drug data and medical records used in our study accessible. This will enable other researchers to validate our findings and build upon our work, fostering collab- oration and advancement in this field. We are acutely aware of the necessity for privacy and data protection. All data utilized has under- gone thorough de-identification, with all sensitive information removed, and verified by a partnering medical institution. We invite doctors to perform only evaluations of model responses without in- volving any form\n",

De- identiﬁed datasets (e.g., MIMIC-IV, UCSF Information Commons) or federated learning approaches can be used to help protect patient privacy 20,21. Evaluating agent-based simulations using an AI-SCE framework Similar to standards and regulations for the autonomous driving industry, identifying robust clinical guidelines and what constitutes a successful interaction for healthcare LLM agents will be crucial towards fulﬁlling the long-term goals of patients, providers, and other clinical stakeholders. In medical education, there has been a shift from assessing students using standardized testing which evaluates shallow clinical reasoning to modern curricula which increasingly use Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) 22. These exams assess a student’s practical skills in the\n",

While the more complex models tested were able to achieve consistently good performance, systemic biases in automated evaluation protocols, and overtly rigid prompting can lead to different conclusions20. While all Large Language Models (LLMs) are exposed to vast amounts of text, including medical textbooks—which theoretically should equip them to handle commonly seen pathologies effectively—we observe substantial variations in their capabilities. Traditionally, evaluation metrics for these models have emphasized the semantic and grammatical accuracy32 of generated text, as well as their proficiency in solving multiple-choice questions.

      "Introduction:\n",
      "This literature review aims to explore the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare, focusing on the development of adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical environments. This review distills findings from multiple academic papers within the './papers/' directory, supplemented by contemporary advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. State-of-the-Art and Key Findings:\n",
      "The current state-of-the-art in LLMs suggests significant promise in integrating AI technology into healthcare diagnostics, with some models achieving notable performance on standard tasks like multiple-choice questions. However, there's increased emphasis on evaluating models based on practical effectiveness in realistic clinical applications rather than traditional metrics. This includes the subjective but critical evaluation of a model's steerability and context-aware reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Methodologies:\n",
      "- The review of methodologies reveals reliance on extensive datasets and progressive training protocols to advance LLM capabilities.\n",
      "- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate vision-text modalities, with ongoing investigations exploring the integration of audio and time-series data to enhance interaction flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Challenges and Limitations:\n",
      "Significant challenges exist in deploying LLMs within healthcare:\n",
      "   a. Hallucination and Misinformation: LLMs potentially produce plausible yet incorrect information, leading to harmful diagnostic decisions.\n",
      "   b. Training and Deployment: There are computational demands, high costs, and difficulties in ensuring the recency of data.\n",
      "   c. Bias and Misuse: Systemic biases learned from large corpora pose ethical risks, compounded by capabilities for misuse, such as model jailbreaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Research Gaps:\n",
      "There remains a need to expand beyond vision-text modalities and include diverse data forms like audio, ensuring models can fully encapsulate various diagnostic processes. Additionally, addressing the nuanced understanding of practical use-case effectiveness in real-world clinical interactions remains underexplored.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Ethical Considerations:\n",
      "Ethical considerations are imperative, particularly concerning data privacy, bias, and AI's role in healthcare:\n",
      "   - Privacy and data de-identification must be a priority, with enforced guidelines for data handling, ensuring patient rights.\n",
      "   - Models should be transparent and open to scrutiny, fostering collaboration among researchers to validate and expand upon findings.\n",
      "\n",

      "**a) Problem Statement:** Despite the promise of LLMs for clinical decision support, a critical gap exists in assuring context-aware responses that can be dynamically steered during real-time diagnostic interactions with healthcare professionals.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**b) Proposed Gen AI Approach:** Develop a Gen AI agent utilizing Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to refine the LLM's response generation capabilities. The integration of agentic workflows (e.g., CrewAI) will allow real-time contextual adjustments based on progressive learning from clinician feedback, enhancing both accuracy and practicality in clinical environments.  \n",

To enhance transparency, we are committed to publicly making the drug data and medical records used in our study accessible. This will enable other researchers to validate our findings and build upon our work, fostering collab- oration and advancement in this field. We are acutely aware of the necessity for privacy and data protection. All data utilized has under- gone thorough de-identification, with all sensitive information removed, and verified by a partnering medical institution. We invite doctors to perform only evaluations of model responses without in- volving any form\n",

      "datasets. 5.1. Medical Diagnosis AI has been under development in medical diagnosis for several decades [170]. While some breakthroughs have been achieved, its role has largely been confined to assisting with some simple diagnostic tasks, such as medical image segmentation, lesion detection and classification. In recent years, with advancements in LLMs and MLLMs, doctors and patients are now expected to rely on these models for more comprehensive diagnosis. Specifically, these models can process subjective descriptions of disease symptoms or medical images, such as X-rays, and leverage embedded medical knowledge to directly generate diagnostic results. For physicians, medical LLMs and MLLMs shorten diagnostic times and reduces workload. For patients, they offers detailed information about their condition along with recovery suggestions. Currently, Med-PaLM 2, one of the top-performing medical LLMs, generates responses to consumer medical and adversarial questions, outperforming\n",

Limitations The MEDAIDE framework, while making signif- icant strides in integrating large-scale medical agents with real clinical environments, has its lim- itations. Currently, the framework incorporates 26,684 drug samples and 506 genuine clinical case records. Despite this scope, it lacks comprehensive coverage, particularly in research on rare diseases and specialized medications. Furthermore, as the initial versions primarily emphasized linguistic pro- cessing, future research aims to extend into multi- modal capabilities, particularly the integration of medical imaging data, to enhance the framework’s ability to process visual information in clinical di- agnostics. The reliance on OpenAI’s API may pose potential operational challenges, suggesting that future studies should explore using more efficient open-source models as viable alternatives.\n",

      "# Multimodal Adaptive Agents for Diverse Diagnostic Data Integration in Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "The integration of diverse diagnostic data presents a pivotal challenge and opportunity in enhancing healthcare outcomes. Current advancements in AI, particularly in multimodal models, hold promise for addressing complexities in diagnostic processes by amalgamating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This proposal outlines a novel approach leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI, including CrewAI agent workflows and advanced Large Language Models like GPT-3.5-turbo, to improve diagnostic accuracy. By reducing misdiagnoses and promoting holistic patient assessments, the approach anticipates significant impacts on clinical practices. However, potential data privacy issues necessitate careful ethical considerations, with proposed strategies ensuring compliance and transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Background & Literature Review\n",
      "The application of AI in healthcare has evolved significantly, with recent efforts focusing on integrating multiple data modalities. Pioneering work, such as the MEDAIDE framework, has laid the foundation by introducing large-scale medical agents within real-world diagnostics, despite some limitations in modality coverage [Source: Adaptive Reasoning Language Agents.pdf]. Current state-of-the-art models like Med-PaLM 2 showcase the effective use of LLMs in reducing diagnostic workloads by processing and generating responses based on medical imagery and symptom descriptions [Source: LLM Agents in Medicine.pdf]. However, the integration of audio and time-series data remains underexplored, representing a gap in ensuring comprehensive diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Problem Statement & Research Gap\n",
      "Existing healthcare AI solutions are typically constrained to limited modalities, overlooking the synergistic potential of integrating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This gap hinders the full leveraging of AI capabilities for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. The proposed research aims to fill this void, enhancing diagnostic tools to foster a multidimensional understanding of patient data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Proposed Gen AI Approach\n",
      "The proposed methodology involves utilizing advanced Generative AI techniques adaptable to multimodal data integration. Specifically, CrewAI agents will orchestrate workflows, while models like GPT-3.5-turbo will underpin processing tasks. By sourcing synchronized datasets encompassing various modalities—vision, text, audio, and time-series—this approach intends to implement comprehensive data processing pipelines. Preprocessing will ensure balanced data integration, essential for effective model training. Additionally, rigorous evaluation metrics will be adopted to assess both component and overall diagnostic performance, addressing challenges noted in existing frameworks [Source: Agents in Clinic.pdf].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expected Impact in Healthcare\n",
      "The anticipated outcome includes a marked enhancement in diagnostic precision. The forecast targets a specific reduction in misdiagnosis rates by a notable percentage within the first few years, using SMART criteria to evaluate progress. Enhanced patient care outcomes, verified by clinical study metrics, are also expected as a direct benefit of the proposed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations or Ethical Considerations\n",
      "Potential challenges such as data privacy and computational demands are significant. Ethical considerations will focus on the responsible use of patient data, considering biases inherent in AI models [Source: LLM Agents in Medicine.pdf]. Proposed strategies include data anonymization and stringent compliance with regulations like HIPAA, alongside fostering model transparency to ensure ethical utilizations.\n",

      "## Abstract\n",
      "Integrating diverse diagnostic data presents a pivotal challenge and significant opportunity for enhancing healthcare outcomes. Current advancements in AI, particularly in multimodal models, show promise in addressing the complexities of diagnostic processes by amalgamating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This proposal outlines a novel approach leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI, including CrewAI agent workflows and advanced Large Language Models such as GPT-3.5-turbo, to improve diagnostic accuracy. By reducing misdiagnoses and promoting holistic patient assessments, the proposed approach anticipates significant impacts on clinical practices. However, potential data privacy issues necessitate careful ethical considerations, with proposed strategies ensuring compliance and transparency. \n",

      "AI application in healthcare has evolved, with recent efforts emphasizing the integration of multiple data modalities. Pioneering work, such as the MEDAIDE framework, introduced large-scale medical agents in real-world diagnostics, despite some limitations in modality coverage [1]. State-of-the-art models like Med-PaLM 2 exemplify the effective use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reducing diagnostic workloads by processing and generating responses based on medical imagery and symptom descriptions [2]. However, the integration of audio and time-series data remains underexplored, representing a gap in achieving comprehensive diagnostics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Problem Statement & Research Gap\n",
      "Current AI healthcare solutions are typically limited to specific modalities, thus underutilizing the potential synergy from integrating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This limitation restricts the potential improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. This research aims to address this gap by developing diagnostic tools that foster a multidimensional understanding of patient data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Proposed Generative AI Approach\n",
      "The methodology involves using advanced Generative AI techniques adaptable to multimodal data integration. CrewAI agents will orchestrate workflows, while models such as GPT-3.5-turbo will underpin processing tasks. By sourcing synchronized datasets encompassing various modalities—vision, text, audio, and time-series—this approach will implement comprehensive data processing pipelines. Preprocessing will ensure balanced data integration, essential for effective model training. Rigorous evaluation metrics will be adopted to assess both the component and overall diagnostic performance, addressing challenges noted in existing frameworks [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expected Impact in Healthcare\n",
      "The anticipated outcome includes significantly enhanced diagnostic precision. Specifically, a reduction in misdiagnosis rates by a notable percentage within the first few years is projected, using SMART criteria to evaluate progress. Enhanced patient care outcomes, verified by clinical study metrics, are expected as a direct benefit of the proposed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations and Ethical Considerations\n",
      "Potential challenges, such as data privacy and computational demands, are significant. Ethical considerations will focus on the responsible use of patient data and biases inherent in AI models [2]. Proposed strategies include data anonymization and stringent compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, alongside fostering model transparency to ensure ethical utilization.\n",

      "# Multimodal Adaptive Agents for Diverse Diagnostic Data Integration in Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "Integrating diverse diagnostic data presents a pivotal challenge and significant opportunity for enhancing healthcare outcomes. Current advancements in AI, particularly in multimodal models, show promise in addressing the complexities of diagnostic processes by amalgamating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This proposal outlines a novel approach leveraging cutting-edge Generative AI, including CrewAI agent workflows and advanced Large Language Models such as GPT-3.5-turbo, to improve diagnostic accuracy. By reducing misdiagnoses and promoting holistic patient assessments, the proposed approach anticipates significant impacts on clinical practices. However, potential data privacy issues necessitate careful ethical considerations, with proposed strategies ensuring compliance and transparency. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Background & Literature Review\n",
      "AI application in healthcare has evolved, with recent efforts emphasizing the integration of multiple data modalities. Pioneering work, such as the MEDAIDE framework, introduced large-scale medical agents in real-world diagnostics, despite some limitations in modality coverage [1]. State-of-the-art models like Med-PaLM 2 exemplify the effective use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reducing diagnostic workloads by processing and generating responses based on medical imagery and symptom descriptions [2]. However, the integration of audio and time-series data remains underexplored, representing a gap in achieving comprehensive diagnostics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Problem Statement & Research Gap\n",
      "Current AI healthcare solutions are typically limited to specific modalities, thus underutilizing the potential synergy from integrating vision, text, audio, and time-series data. This limitation restricts the potential improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. This research aims to address this gap by developing diagnostic tools that foster a multidimensional understanding of patient data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Proposed Generative AI Approach\n",
      "The methodology involves using advanced Generative AI techniques adaptable to multimodal data integration. CrewAI agents will orchestrate workflows, while models such as GPT-3.5-turbo will underpin processing tasks. By sourcing synchronized datasets encompassing various modalities—vision, text, audio, and time-series—this approach will implement comprehensive data processing pipelines. Preprocessing will ensure balanced data integration, essential for effective model training. Rigorous evaluation metrics will be adopted to assess both the component and overall diagnostic performance, addressing challenges noted in existing frameworks [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expected Impact in Healthcare\n",
      "The anticipated outcome includes significantly enhanced diagnostic precision. Specifically, a reduction in misdiagnosis rates by a notable percentage within the first few years is projected, using SMART criteria to evaluate progress. Enhanced patient care outcomes, verified by clinical study metrics, are expected as a direct benefit of the proposed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations and Ethical Considerations\n",
      "Potential challenges, such as data privacy and computational demands, are significant. Ethical considerations will focus on the responsible use of patient data and biases inherent in AI models [2]. Proposed strategies include data anonymization and stringent compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, alongside fostering model transparency to ensure ethical utilization.\n",
